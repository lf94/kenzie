This stand's default holding dimensions are 70mm by 162mm - big enough for a
smartphone. Don't let this stop you from adjust the parameters to generate new
types of stands!

## Motivation

This was originally inspired by book stands and designed for creating a stand
for the Retroid Pocket 2 handheld gaming device.
