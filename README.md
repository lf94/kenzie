A parametric stand which can hold a variety of objects at adjustable angles.

This stand's default holding dimensions are 70mm by 162mm - big enough for a
smartphone.

## Motivation

This was originally inspired by book stands and designed for creating a stand
for the Retroid Pocket 2 handheld gaming device.
